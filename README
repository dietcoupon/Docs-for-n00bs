Just two for now:

Ruby for dummies is a compilation of terms and conventions gleaned from the Pickaxe book and refined via googling. As a novice, I've often found the level of assumed common knowledge both staggering and frustrating. This doc serves as a handy cheat-sheet-type reference, but in its creation and maintenance various aspects of the language reveal themselves, in their capabilities and limitations and the ways they prop each other up to enable ruby to be the beautiful, powerful creature it is.

The 15 minutes blog is a text-based adaptation of the lauded screencast. To create a blog in 15 minutes was an artificiality, as the code was often pasted in and ill-explained, passing by the screen too quickly for much more than to notice it's there. Paradoxically, the screencast veered to concepts which are useful for making a rails application for sure, but were more irrelevant for the task at hand. It was nearly impossible to apply the content as it was presented, so converting it to text demystifies the process and presents the same information in a more useful way.
