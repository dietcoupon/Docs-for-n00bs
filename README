Just two for now:

Ruby for dummies is a compilation of terms and conventions gleaned from myriad Ruby books and refined via googling. As a novice, it can be difficult to communicate or understand what's going on in a language without a proper understanding of the assumed common vocabulary and knowledge. This doc serves as a handy cheat-sheet-type reference of Ruby's internal structure and some of its syntax.

The 15 minutes blog is a text-based adaptation of the lauded screencast. To create a blog in 15 minutes was an artificiality, as the code was often pasted in and ill-explained, passing by the screen too quickly for much more than to notice it's there. Paradoxically, the screencast veered to concepts which are useful for making a rails application for sure, but were more irrelevant for the task at hand. It was nearly impossible to apply the content as it was presented, so converting it to text demystifies the process and presents the same information in a more useful way.
